Dear players

hello everyone! We are the development team for the "Mountain's Poem" mod. Firstly, we would like to express our sincerest gratitude to every player who supports and loves this mod. In the past development process, your encouragement and suggestion have given us great motivation. Unfortunately, due to various uncontrollable factors, we have to make a difficult decision: to temporarily put this module on hold and enter a dormant period.

Our team encountered many challenges during the development process, including but not limited to damage to the MCreator workspace, crashes of the MCreator plugin, and failure to import automatically written code into the library, which prevented us from smoothly reading and using this code in IntelliJ IDEA. These issues not only hindered our development process, but also caused great difficulties for our team. After a long period of discussion and consideration, we unanimously agree that continuing to develop the current version of the module has become extremely difficult, even hopeless.

Knowing the players' expectations for our mod, our hearts are filled with guilt. We understand that 'Fenglian Ci' is not just a game mod, it carries the passion and dreams of many players. In order to ensure the quality and stability of the module, after careful consideration, we have decided to stop updating the module on January 22, 2025 at 00:00 (Beijing time). During this period, we will make every effort to try to fix the existing issues and strive to restart development in the future, but the specific time is still uncertain.

In order to encourage more people to participate in this project, we have open sourced the workspace of version 1.5.0 of MCreator (which is now damaged) to GitHub. If any experts or developers are willing to take over and help us fix this mod, please feel free to contact our development team (QQ group 861428846). Your participation will be an important force for us to overcome the current difficulties, and we would greatly appreciate your support and assistance.

During the brief dormancy period, we encourage everyone to continue playing 'Feng Lianci' and enjoy the fun. We are well aware that it is precisely because of your company that this mod appears so exciting. Despite the difficulties we are currently facing, we still believe that one day in the future, we will regroup our strength and once again provide everyone with a better gaming experience.

Finally, thank you once again for your love and support of 'Fenglian Ci'! I hope to reunite with all players in the future and create even better memories together.

Best wishes!

亲爱的玩家们：

大家好！我们是《峰恋辞》模组的开发团队。首先，我们要对每一位支持和喜爱这个模组的玩家表达最诚挚的感谢。在过去的开发过程中，您的一句鼓励、一个建议，都给予了我们莫大的动力。然而，非常遗憾的是，由于多方面的不可抗因素，我们不得不做出一个艰难的决定：将本模组暂时搁置，进入休眠期。

我们的团队在开发过程中遇到了许多挑战，其中包括但不限于MCreator工作区的损坏、MCreator插件的崩溃、以及MCreator自动编写的代码未能正常导入库，导致我们无法在IntelliJ IDEA中顺利读取和使用这些代码。这些问题不仅使得我们的开发进程受阻，而且也给我们的团队带来了极大的困扰。在经过长时间的商讨与考虑后，我们一致认为，继续开发当前版本的模组已变得异常困难，甚至是无望。

了解到玩家们对我们模组的期待，我们的内心充满愧疚。我们明白，《峰恋辞》不仅仅是一款游戏模组，它承载着众多玩家的热情与梦想。为了保证模组的质量与稳定性，我们经过深思熟虑，决定在2025年1月22日00:00（北京时间）停止对该模组的更新。在此期间，我们将全力以赴尝试修复存在的问题，并争取在未来能够重启开发，但具体时间尚不确定。

为了让更多的人参与到这个项目中来，我们将1.5.0版本的MCreator（已损坏）的工作区开源至GitHub。如果有任何专家、开发者愿意接手并帮助我们修复这个模组，请随时联系我们的开发团队（QQ群861428846）。您的参与将成为我们克服目前困境的重要力量，我们会非常感激您的支持与帮助。

在短暂的休眠期里，我们鼓励大家继续游玩《峰恋辞》，享受其中的乐趣。我们深知，正是因为有你们的陪伴，这个模组才显得如此精彩。尽管我们现在面临困难，但是我们依然相信，在未来的某一天，我们会重新聚集力量，再次为大家奉上更优质的游戏体验。

最后，再次感谢大家对《峰恋辞》的热爱与支持！希望未来能与各位玩家再次相聚，共同创造更加美好的回忆。

祝好！
